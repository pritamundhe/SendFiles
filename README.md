# SendFiles 📱✨

Hey there! Welcome to **SendFiles**, a smart and handy Android application built with React Native.

This app makes sharing documents a breeze. It uses your phone's camera to instantly detect **Indian phone numbers (+91)** and **email addresses** using on-device OCR. No more typing out numbers manually—just point, scan, and send files directly via WhatsApp!

## 🚀 Features

*   **Smart OCR Scanning**: Instantly recognizes phone numbers and emails using Google's ML Kit.
*   **India-Ready**: Specifically tuned to detect Indian mobile numbers (automatically adds +91 if missing).
*   **QR Code Support**: Scans QR codes to quickly grab links or text.
*   **Seamless Sharing**: Pick PDFs or images and send them straight to the scanned WhatsApp number.
*   **Privacy First**: All scanning happens **on-device**. No data is sent to external servers for processing.
*   **User Friendly**: Simple, clean interface with a focus on speed.
